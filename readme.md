## version 3.20.18
#### issues remaining:
    1. 3B -> shuffling board
    2. image credits
    3. you win -> 
       3A. something useful to submit as evidence
       3B. new game
#### thoughts:
    A) Count to know that it was a match
        A1) or a character that does something everytime there's a match
    B) alt for images?

## version 3.13.18

#### issues remaining:
    1. timing: winning message shows up before last image shows
    2. 2nd card not displaying when clicked, moves immediately to checkMatch()
    3. *Transitions are too fast to see what is happening
    4. when 3rd card is clicked, transition timing concern
#### other thoughts:
    A) You win message -> something useful to submit as evidence

       1A. 4X4 GRID LOOK

## version 3.13.18
#### issues remaining:
    1. timing: winning message shows up before last image shows
    2. 2nd card not displaying when clicked, moves immediately to checkMatch()
    3. *Transitions are too fast to see what is happening
    4. when 3rd card is clicked, transition timing concern
#### other thoughts:
    A) You win message -> something useful to submit as evidence
